# C Core Concepts

A personal collection of well-structured programs written in C to reinforce essential concepts of the language.

While C isn't the most common language in day-to-day development today, it remains one of the most powerful ways to understand what really happens under the hood â€” memory, pointers, arrays, and raw data manipulation.

## ðŸ’¡ Topics covered

- Arrays and loops
- Pointers and memory addressing
- Functions and parameter passing
- Simple data processing logic
- Basic systems for input/output and conditional logic

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The code is organized by topic folders:
- `arrays/`: manipulation, inversion, average, variance
- `pointers/`: pointer arithmetic, dereferencing
- `functions/`: reusable logic, return values, reference parameters
- `basics/`: small logic projects like people registration and value filtering

## ðŸš€ Running the programs

You can compile each `.c` file using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program
